        "Unguarded brick and mortar soak up rain like a wick. During a New Jersey winter, this trapped water expands as it freezes, leading to 'spalling' (brick faces popping off), cracked crowns, and white salt stains known as efflorescence. Most chimneys in Lakewood and surrounding areas are already showing signs of this invisible damage.",
        "Hom3li applies professional-grade, breathable penetrants that soak up to half an inch deep into the masonry. Unlike cheap hardware store sealers that trap moisture inside and cause more damage, our siloxane/silane treatments are 100% vapor-permeable. This means liquid water stays out, but internal moisture can still escape, keeping your chimney dry and structurally sound for a decade or more.",
